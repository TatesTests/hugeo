## Setup

1. Add your site and author details in `config.toml`.
2. Add your Google Analytics and Disqus keys to `config.toml`.
3. Get a workflow going to see your site's output (with [CloudCannon](https://app.cloudcannon.com/) or Hugo locally).

## Develop

Justice was built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) version `0.80.0`, but should support newer versions as well.

Run the standalone executable `hugo` to serve the site locally:

~~~bash
$ hugo server
~~~

### Posts

* Add, update or remove a post in the *posts* section.
* The **author** field links to the **authors** data.
* Change the defaults when new posts are created in `_posts/_defaults.md`.

### Contact Form

* Preconfigured to work with [CloudCannon](https://app.cloudcannon.com/), but easily changed to another provider (e.g. [FormSpree](https://formspree.io/)).
* Sends email to the address listed in company details.

### Author

* Reused around the site to save multiple editing locations.

### Footer

* Set how this displays with each page front matter in `menu.footer`.

### Company details
